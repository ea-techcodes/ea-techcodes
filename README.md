<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Esther Ayun. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“</h2>
<p align="center">I'm currently a "WIP" while deepening my knowledge and skills in Data Analytics. I'm passionate about areas of data visualisation on Tableau, amazing SQL syntaxes and of course the powerful exploration of Excel as a tool. I've started exploring other visualisation tools too such as Looker and Power BI too, gaining extra side knowledge on R and Python âœ¨ and hope to contribute to that field as well. 
</p>

<p align="center">When Iâ€™m not deep into learning or coding, youâ€™ll likely find me enjoying a good Netflix binge, on the hunt for the perfect brewed coffee, or catching up with the latest trends and news on social media. Hiking has always held a special place in my heart, even if I donâ€™t get to do it as often as Iâ€™d like ðŸ˜¢. And yes, memes are always welcomeâ€”theyâ€™re the perfect dose of daily humor! ðŸ˜‚. </p>

<p align="center">Feel free to reach out to me on my email for any collaborations or work projects with regards to relevant topics mentioned. Looking forward to hear from you soon!. </p>
